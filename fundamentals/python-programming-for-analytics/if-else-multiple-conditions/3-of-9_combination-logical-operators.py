In the previous exercise, we computed the average rating of the apps with a genre that is either 
"Social Networking" or "Games." We can ask even more specific questions, like these:

-- What is the average rating of free apps with a genre that is either "Social Networking" or "Games"?
-- What is the average rating of not free apps with a genre that is either "Social Networking" or "Games"?
