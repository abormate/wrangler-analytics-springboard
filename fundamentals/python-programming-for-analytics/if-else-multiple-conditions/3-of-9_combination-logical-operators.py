In the previous exercise, we computed the average rating of the apps with a genre that is either 
"Social Networking" or "Games." We can ask even more specific questions, like these:

-- What is the average rating of free apps with a genre that is either "Social Networking" or "Games"?
-- What is the average rating of not free apps with a genre that is either "Social Networking" or "Games"?

"""

To answer the first question, we need to isolate the apps that meet both criteria:

-- Are in either the "Social Networking" or "Games" genre
-- Have a price of 0.0
