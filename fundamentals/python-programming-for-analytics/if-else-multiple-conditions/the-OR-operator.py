"Social Networking," while the genre for Clash of Clans and Temple Run is "Games"

Since social networking apps and games are usually popular, we may want to further investigate this 
category. One thing we might want to determine is the average rating of this category that encompasses 
games and social networking apps.

To do that, we need to isolate the ratings of all the apps whose genre is either "Social Networking" 
or "Games" into a separate list. Then, we can compute the average value using techniques we already know.

If we want to isolate the ratings of these apps using the condition if genre == 'Social Networking' 
and genre == 'Games', we'll end up with an empty list because there's no app with a genre that is 
both "Social Networking" and "Games" â€” an app can only have one genre.

Returning to our apps example, the condition if genre == 'Social Networking' or genre == 'Games' 
resolves to False when an app's genre is neither "Social Networking" nor "Games." Otherwise, it

of either "Social Networking" or "Games.
